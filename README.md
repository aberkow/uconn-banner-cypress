UConn Banner
=================

A (UConn brand) standards-compliant implementation of the University's web banner. 


History
=====

As with most of our recent [web branding](http://brand.uconn.edu/standards/web/) efforts, University Communications has teamed with the UITS Web Dev Lab to create a new look for the University's web presence. While the majority of university departments and organizations can be brought into brand compliance through the use of the [Aurora](http://aurora.uconn.edu/) (WordPress) platform courtesy of UITS, there is still a need for static templates. This project attempts to bridge that gap.

Who should use this?
=================

Anyone building a new *.uconn.edu website that won't be hosting on the Aurora platform. 


How to use it:
==============

There are a number of ways to use this code. Here are two:

1. *Basic* - You can [download the latest zip file](https://github.com/uconn/banner/archive/master.zip) and use the assets in the "_sites" directory to start building your website.
2. *Advanced* - Clone/download this repo and use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) to build your entire website.

```bash
	git clone https://github.com/uconn/banner.git
	cd banner
	compass watch &
	jekyll serve --watch
```
